Solutions to HW2 Exercise1
- Run the **exercise1.cpp** using g++ to see the test outputs. Don't forget to link to the **Boost** library!
- To run the code: g++ -std=c++11 exercise1.cpp -o test -I C:/boost/include/boost-1_80 -L C:/boost/lib -lws2_32 -lwsock32
- Note: the path after -I and -L should be the **include and lib paths** for the locally installed Boost library.
